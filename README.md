# Fake News Prediction
## Machine Learning Assignment - VANINI

### Problem statement
Fake news and misinformation is a major problem of the modern, connected world. What makes Fake News an extremely hard problem to solve is the difficulty in identifying, tracking, and controlling unreliable content. 
First of all, this issue is primarily a social problem and a good solution of my task would require advanced digital technologies and protocols for assessing content however I'm going to try the Natural Language Processors to detect if a news text is fake or not.

The project consists in a classification problem of fake news prediction.
The dataset is taken from this Kaggle repository - https://www.kaggle.com/clmentbisaillon/fake-and-real-news-dataset#True.csv which contains two dataset: 
1. the first one contains a list of articles considered as "real" news;
2. the seconde one ontains a list of articles considered as "fake" news;

There are 21417 true news data and 23481 fake news data given in the true and fake CSV files respectively.

I treat the problem at hand as a binary classification task, to understand how related or unrelated the reported news when compared to the real news. 

### Project overview
The assignment is divided into steps:
- Data exploration and preparation 
- Build and Train The Model
- Asses trained model performance
- I algorithm: Support Vector Classifier
- II algorithm: Logistic Regression
- III algorithm: Naive Bayes Classifier
- IV algorithm: Decision Tree
- V algorithm: Ensamble Methods (Random Forest)
- Analysis results
