# FakeNewsPrediction
Fake news and misinformation is a major problem of the modern, connected world. What makes Fake News an extremely hard problem to solve is the difficulty in identifying, tracking, and controlling unreliable content. 
First of all, this issue is primarily a social problem and a good solution of my task would require advanced digital technologies and protocols for assessing content however I'm going to try the Natural Language Processors to detect if a news text is fake or not.

The project consists in a classification problem of fake news prediction.
The dataset is taken from this Kaggle repository - https://www.kaggle.com/clmentbisaillon/fake-and-real-news-dataset#True.csv which contains two dataset: 
1. the first one contains a list of articles considered as "real" news;
2. the seconde one ontains a list of articles considered as "fake" news;

I treat the problem at hand as a binary classification task, to understand how related or unrelated the reported news when compared to the real news. 

### Project overview
The assignment is divided into steps:
- Data exploration and preparation 
- I algorithm: Support Vector Classifier
- II algorithm: Nearest Neighbor
- III algorithm: Decision Tree
- IV algorithm: Ensamble Methods (Random Forest / Extra Trees plus Boosting)
- Analysis results
